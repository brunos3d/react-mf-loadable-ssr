# React SSR + Loadable + Module Federation example

This project contains a set of progressive samples that demonstrate how to use [Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/).

It's part of this article.

## Samples

- sample-01: It's a simple Express server that renders a React app. It will be used as a base for the other samples.
- sample-02: It adds [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/) to the previous sample and refactors the code to use dynamic imports.
